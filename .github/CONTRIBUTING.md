**Did you find a bug?**
- **Verify the bug lies in PROS.** We receive quite a few reports that are due to bugs in user code, not the kernel.
- Ensure the bug wasn't already reported by searching GitHub [issues](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/issues)
- If you're unable to find an issue, [open](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/issues/new) a new one.

**Did you patch a bug or add a new feature?**
1. [Fork](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/fork) and clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
5. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed. In order to ensure that the PROS kernel is stable, we take extra time to test pull requests. As a result, your pull request may take some time to be merged into master.

Here are a few tips that can help expedite your pull request being accepted:
- Follow existing code's style.
- Document why you made the changes you did
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If you have multiple independent changes, make a pull request for each.
- If you did some testing, describe your procedure and results.
- If you're fixing an issue, reference it by number
